```

## Create a new project

Change to whereever you want to create the new project directory, then run:

```sh
cookiecutter gh:chizovation/cookiecutter
```

and follow the prompts.

## User Config

If you use Cookiecutter a lot, youâ€™ll find it useful to have a user config
file. By default Cookiecutter tries to retrieve settings from a .cookiecutterrc
file in your home directory.

```yaml
default_context:
  # values used with chizovation's cookiecutter
  full_name: 'Devin Townsend'
  email: 'devin@example.com'
  github_owner: 'poozerOrg'
```

You can read the official documentation [here][cookiecutter-user-config].
